NL3011CL8A | 2004 - dec 2009 | 30/40 dead from group of 80

歼 annihilate, wipe out, kill off
坚 hard, strong, firm; resolute
间 midpoint, space; place, locality

vomit several times a day
and see your own body mass grow, double in size 
in a continuous cytokinestorm
and feel your pancreas break down
under the enjoyment of popcorn lungs
and some severe biological electromagnetic damage for a couple of years
get all your teeth ripped out
smell death breathing in the chair next to you
